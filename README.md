# Research Navigator

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built to explore modern AI development practices through hands-on implementation.

## Project Overview

Research Navigator is a document-based question-answering system that demonstrates RAG architecture patterns. This repository documents both the implementation and the learning journey involved in building production-ready AI applications.

## Current Status

**Version**: 0.1.0-dev  
**Phase**: Project initialization and baseline setup

The project follows a sequential development approach where each phase introduces new concepts while building upon previous implementations. Each version represents a complete, working system with incremental improvements.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: LangChain, LangGraph
- **Local AI**: Ollama, sentence-transformers
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
- **Development**: Python 3.11+, Pydantic, pytest
- **Interface**: Streamlit

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- macOS (M4 optimized)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research-navigator.git
cd research-navigator

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setup Local AI

```bash
# Install Ollama if not already installed
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull a model
ollama pull llama3.2
```

## Development Approach

This project emphasizes learning through implementation. Each development cycle focuses on a single feature, ensuring deep understanding of the underlying concepts before moving to the next component.

The codebase prioritizes:
- Type safety with Pydantic models
- Comprehensive testing
- Clear documentation
- Modular architecture

## Contributing

This is primarily a learning project. The development process and architectural decisions are documented in commit messages and code comments to serve as a reference for similar implementations.
